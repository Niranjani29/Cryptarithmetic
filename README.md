Cryptarithmetic is a genre of mathematical puzzles in which the digits are replaced by letters of the alphabet or other symbols. If the same letter occurs more than once, it must be assigned the same digit each time. No two different letters may be assigned the same digit. So, the problem is to find the unique digit corresponding to a unique letter. Cryptarithmetic is the science and art of creating and solving cryptarithmetic. J. A. Hunter coined the word alphametic to designate a cryptarithmetic whose letters form sensible words or phrases.
